For more information, click the Information button in the main menu.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Referral acceptance must occur before activating the glasses. If you have already activated the glasses before accepting the referral and it's been less than a week, please contact Meta support.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Both the referred person and the referrer must be from the same country. If you are from different countries, using a VPN might work, but we do not guarantee its functionality.\n\nüòé VIEWER\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Firstly, request a referral under \"Request > Viewer\" and obtain the corresponding referral link.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ After obtaining the referral link, click on it, and it will open in the browser. You must create a Meta account if you don't have one or log in if you already have an account. Then, accept the recommendation. The process will end with a message on the screen stating that you have accepted the purchase recommendation and can proceed to purchase a viewer.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Once the recommendation is accepted and the viewer is at home, proceed to turn on the glasses and complete the activation process. Sign in with the same account that accepted the recommendation.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Upon reaching the main menu of the glasses (initially displaying a menu bar with the profile, time, and various applications), you will receive a notification that you have a balance of ‚Ç¨30 in your account. If this is not the case, please contact Meta support, providing the full names, email addresses associated with the accounts, and Nicknames registered for both the referred person and the referrer. Sometimes they may also request the serial number of the viewer or a screenshot of where the referral link was provided (in case of chat).\n\nüì± APPLICATIONS\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Firstly, request a referral under \"Request > Application\" and obtain the corresponding referral link.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ The bot will ask for the name of the game; it must be spelled correctly, or the search will not be correct.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Once the game or application is selected, proceed to accept the referral. Usually, there is a 25% discount; if it's less, the person does not accept more balance. If the amount is not 25%, preferably do not accept and request another referral.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ After accepting the application recommendation, proceed to make the purchase. The application's payment section will show a corresponding 25% discount. If not, it means you have not accepted the referral correctly."
